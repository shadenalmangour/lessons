# Wireframes and User Stories

## What Is a Wireframe?

A **wireframe** is an image that sketches out the layout of major pieces of
content within a page, without all of the fully-rendered detail that might be
present in an illustration.

Although making detailed, feature-rich wireframes is typically the province of
the UX/UI designer, even developers can produce basic layout sketches, and these
sketches are extremely useful in the planning process as a tool to clarify and
codify your vision. They also segue easily into mocking up a site with boxes, so
that you know how to actually build your layout.

### Wireframes vs Mockups

Wireframes and mockups are  ways to visualize an application.  They differ in
the the "degree" of fidelity.  Wireframes are lower fidelity, often using
placeholders for content, no colors, no fonts, and no assets.  Mockups are are
higher fidelity, often utilizing colors, typography, images, and other assets.

**Low-fidelity:**

- wireframes (paper or marker)
- wireframes (digital)

| Pros  |  Cons  |
| ------|----|
| speed | uninspiring |
| easy to change | vague |
| inexpensive | feel incomplete |
| skeleton of application | lack of guidance |

**High-fidelity:**

- mockups (no interactions)
- mockups (interactivity)

| Pros  |  Cons  |
| ------|----|
| stakeholder language | more time |
| more inspiring | harder to change  |
| user's perspective | more costly |

### Wireframing in WDI

Within the scope of this course, we will not be expecting you to produce
designer-level wireframes; however, we _will_ expect you to produce low-fidelity
sketches for your projects. A low-fidelity wireframe or sketch is simple -- just
complex enough to convey the gist of the page -- and may feature minimal text
placeholders for images, or skeletons of interactive features like drop-down
menus and pop-ups or modals.

It should usually not concern itself with things like:

- color scheme
- fonts
- specific content (images, written copy, etc)
- animations and timing

If you find yourself diving into those details, you may be going too deep. The
purpose of a sketch is to be light, flexible, and even disposable if necessary.

Below are some examples of sketches submitted in previous cohorts. Some are
higher fidelity and some are lower; some were drawn by hand and some were drawn
using design tools like Balsamiq; however, **any** of the following would be
considered acceptable wireframes for a project.

In general, since hand-drawn wireframes are easier to iterate on and maintain
than computer-drawn ones, we recommend that in the scope of this course, you do
all your wireframing by hand.

### Lab: Wireframes

In pairs, pick one of the eight following sites and draw a basic sketch for
the site on a patch of whiteboard. Focus on capturing the key elements of layout
for the page, but **DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REAL TEXT**. When you're finished, rotate
within your squads (A->B, B->C, etc.) and see if you can identify your
teammate's site using only their sketch. Then, take a few minutes and give each
other feedback on the sketches, specifically pointing out aspects that were more
clear or less clear.

## What is a User Story?

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail. 

Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like scrum and kanban. In scrum, user stories are added to sprints and “burned down” over the duration of the sprint. Kanban teams pull user stories into their backlog and run them through their workflow. It’s this work on user stories that help scrum teams get better at estimation and sprint planning, leading to more accurate forecasting and greater agility. Thanks to stories, kanban teams learn how to manage work-in-progress (WIP) and can further refine their workflows.

- Stories keep the focus on the user. 
- Stories enable collaboration.
- Stories drive creative solutions.

User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:
> “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

- *"As a [persona]":* Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.

- *“Wants to”:* Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.

- *“So that”:* how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?

Examples of user stories
>As an unregistered user, I want to sign up with email and password, so that I can join the social network.
>As a registered user, I want to post a photo, so that I can share my experiences.
