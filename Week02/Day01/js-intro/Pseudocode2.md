## High Level Pseudocode

### Objectives
- learn what pseudocode is
- learn how to use it to break down problems into discrete operations


### Context
High-level pseudocode is used to break a large general probelm into smaller chunks / operations / statments about what the computer should do next.

### Pseudocode example: Pour water into a glass
Instruct a robot to pour water from a bottle into a glass.

### Exercise: How to Make a PB&J Sandwich (10 minutes / 0:15)
Pair up and write down your pseudocode.

> A. This example's sequence is very thorough! However, we are still assuming certain conditions that our utensils or ingredients already exist. What if we are out of plates? Will we grab a napkin instead to place our sandwich on? What if we are out of jelly? Will you throw the sandwich away or eat it with just peanut butter?
