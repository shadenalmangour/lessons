# Lab: The DOM

## Change the Logo!

No homepage is safe from the logo bandit!

- Open up https://www.google.com in Chrome or Firefox, and open up the JavaScript console.
- Find the Google logo and store it in a variable.
- Save the current `src` attribute into a variable
- Modify the source of the logo IMG so that it's a Yahoo logo instead.
  - You can use this url for the Yahoo Logo: https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/4fd8dcb7eab8eab648000004-750-143.jpg
  - Hint: You will need to figure out how to remove the `srcset` attribute for this!
- Find the Google search button and store it in a variable.
- Modify the text of the button so that it says "Yahooo!" instead.
