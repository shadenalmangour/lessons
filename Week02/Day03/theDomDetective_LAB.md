# Lab: DOM Access

## DOM Detective

Open up [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) in Chrome or Firefox, and open up the JavaScript console (CMD + Option + J on Macs).

Use DOM access methods (e.g. `document.querySelector`) to find the following parts of the page. You probably first want to use Inspect Element to figure out what their tag names, classes, and IDs are.

- Every image on the page
- The navigation area in the upper right
- The MailChimp sign-up form in the bottom
- The upper left-hand logo that says GDI (Hint: use CSS descendant selectors)
- The logos of the media sources that featured GirlDevelopIt (lifeHacker, TED, etc., at the bottom of the page)
- The big heading that says "DON'T BE SHY DEVELOP IT"
- All of the headings that have the underline (e.g. Who we are, We are now in 63 cities)
- All of the images that are in the stats part of the page (e.g. 26%, 18% and 34%)
- BONUS: all the dots in the map
